Installation
------------

0. Download the 3rd party library paco, located at:
   http://plv.mpi-sws.org/paco/paco-1.2.7.zip
   More info about the project can be found at:
	 http://plv.mpi-sws.org/paco/

1. Unzip the paco project and run 'make install' in the 'src' folder of the
   project. This will install 'paco' in the Coq installation directory such that
   it can be 'Required' like any other standard library module.

2. Now run 'make install' in the 'src' folder of the Moessner project in order
   to compile all Coq scripts.

3. The code base of the Moessner project is now ready to be explored and stepped
   through.
